This project is to be a music player that will take your current geographical location, and play music based on your location.

You can set the mood for anywhere in the world with your specific music tastes.

# Testing

Ensure you have a suitable emulator attached to your VS Code. I reccomend Android iOS Emulator v1.6.0 by Diemas Michiels.
